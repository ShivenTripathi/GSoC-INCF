# GSoC-INCF
Codes written while working as GSoC Student, in HDNet, INCF, 2021

To Do:
- [] Play Around with Codes
- [] Create Reading List
- [x] Add Old Codebase: 
    - Codes from Drive Not downloaded: [Old data files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13zLBJ2eyx2u-9tp7w_G_wTKoeuBY8vbu?usp=sharing)
    - Codes from email from Michael downloaded
    - Codes from email from Prof. Joost downloaded

- After Meeting on 25/05/2021:
    1. Read through papers:
        * [Stimulus-dependent Maximum Entropy Models of Neural Population Codes](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002922) 

        * [Weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states in a neural population](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04701)

        * [The simplest maximum entropy model for collective behavior in a neural network](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2013/03/P03011/meta)

    2. Look how Maximum Entropy model is fit from existing code
    3. Devise strategies for validation for different models
    4. think of how this would translate to code
    5. discuss design choices with Chris
