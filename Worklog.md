1. Types of Models:
    * First Order:
        * S1:

        * T1
        * Independent Model
    * Second Order:
        * S2
        * T2
        * Independent Model + Correlation
2. For single neurons, S2 predicts firing rates better than S1 model
3. S2 is better in predicting population neural responses - quantified by log-likelihood ratio
3. S2 predicts probabilities of patterns of activity with minimal bias
