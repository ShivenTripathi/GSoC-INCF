### 24/05/2021
1. Added old codes
2. Start Maintaining Reading List/Tasks in README

### 25/05/2021
1. Maybe more frequent(biweekly) meetings, right now booked for Tuesdays
2. Also discuss with Chris often

1. Types of Models:
    * First Order:
        * S1
        * T1
        * Independent Model
    * Second Order:
        * S2
        * T2
        * Independent Model + Correlation
2. For single neurons, S2 predicts firing rates better than S1 model
3. S2 is better in predicting population neural responses - quantified by log-likelihood ratio
3. S2 predicts probabilities of patterns of activity with minimal bias - S1 assigns low probab. to some codes, to the extent they dont get generated

### 01/06/2021
1. Watching course- Computational Neuroscience, Coursera UoW
2. Meeting:
    * Got demo file to use
    * One way to test validation: model returns 1st 2nd 3rd order correlations
    * What validation to use clearer now, run the demo, understand how it would be fit, and then discuss with Chris
